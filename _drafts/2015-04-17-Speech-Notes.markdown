Michael Bloomberg:
  Harvard: give others the oppotunity to speach,

  Bloomberg by bloomberg: the harder you work, the luckier you would be
              Things you can control in your life, how hard you work, how honest you are
              how well you dealing with others

  Focus on current, and future, not "I should have" you cannot control what have happen
    but you need to learn from that

Ophrah Winfrey:
  The highest fullfilment, truthfullness, of your life

  Failure is just the other way life teach us.

  Learn from your every failure.


My own experience:
  Being reasonable, use your reason to control your emotions, don't let your emotion
  overtaken the control of your actions.
