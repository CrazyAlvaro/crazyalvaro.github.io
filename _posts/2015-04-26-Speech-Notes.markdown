Here's are some quotes that I came across recently that I strongly agree with and would like to
write them down and share with other people.

###[Bloomberg on How to Start a Business and Make Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPRD8__10w)###

>Once finished, gone, life continues. "You can't sit there, should have would have
>could have is not a particular useful thing to spend your time doing, it will
>just leave your heart sick. or will leave you living a past life and
>**not looking towards what could be great tomorrow.**

>**The only thing** that you can control that influences success in life
>is **how hard you work, how honest you are, and how well you deal with others**

>long-term you are better off is you work harder, you are better off if you're honest
>you're better off if you give others credit get them to help you by helping them.

>Street smarts and common sense are every important.

>**There is no such thing as failure. Failure is just life trying to move us in another
>direction.**

>learn from every mistake because every experience, encounter,

>and then go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”**
